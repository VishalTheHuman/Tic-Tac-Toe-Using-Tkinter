## **Description 📑**
🟢 The Tic-Tac-Toe using Tkinter project is a classic game implementation that brings the age-old game of Tic-Tac-Toe to life with a modern graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library in Python. Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a two-player game where the objective is to form a line of three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid.

🟡 This project offers an interactive and user-friendly experience, allowing two players to take turns making their moves on the game board until one of them wins by forming a winning combination or the game ends in a draw. It serves as an excellent example of how to create a simple yet engaging desktop application using Python and Tkinter.

## **Features 💫**
🟥 *Graphical User Interface:* The game features a visually appealing GUI designed with Tkinter, making it easy and enjoyable to play.

🟧 *Two-Player Mode:* Supports multiplayer gameplay, allowing two players to take turns on the same computer.

🟨 *Winning Logic:* Implements the winning conditions of Tic-Tac-Toe, determining and declaring the winner when a player forms a line of three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

🟫 *Game State Management:* Keeps track of the game's state, including whose turn it is and whether the game has ended in a win or a draw.

🟩 *Reset and Replay:* Provides options to reset the game for a new round or replay the current game without restarting the application.
